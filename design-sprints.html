                        For this discovery work, we were given the freedom to think outside the box and not be bound by current framework restrictions.

                    Below is a discovery process Mitratech employs. It’s a highly collaborative process, not only internally, but with our customers as well. Through client calls and onsite visits, we discover the customers’ workflows, pain points, and wishlists. From there, we create a value map with ideas and concepts that would relieve pains and create confidence in our users. After validating the ideas with our users, we go into a design sprint to further flesh out the high-level concepts. We share the outputs from the design sprint with our internal stakeholders, as well as our clients, to ensure that we have successfully created meaningful solutions.

                    Vendor<span class='emphasize'>*</span> and TK<span class='emphasize'>*</span> onboarding is core to Collaborati, and it’s currently a cumbersome process.
                    <a target='_blank' href='https://www.mitratech.com/products/collaborati/'>Collaborati</a> 
                    is an e-billing software that allows law firms to invoice their clients, who are customers of 
                    <a target='_blank' href='https://www.mitratech.com/products/teamconnect/'>TeamConnect</a>, an enterprise legal management platform. 
                    In order to establish a client-vendor relationship, the vendor must onboard to Collaborati, and the vendor information must be entered in TeamConnect by the client. 
                    Once that’s done, the law firms can submit the timekeepers and their rates through Collaborati, which will then show up in 
                    <a target='_blank' href='https://success.mitratech.com/TeamConnect/TeamConnect_Module_Guides/Collaborati_Spend_Management_-_CSM'>TeamConnect CSM</a>

                    A design sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and gathering feedback from customers. 
                    We actually experimented with our design sprints and have tried various lengths: one week, a week and a half, and two weeks. 
                    In the end, we decided that one-week sprints worked best for us. During the design sprints, we got together and collaborated on how to solve a specific problem from many different angles. 
                    We have had a total of 5 design sprints so far to streamline the VTKO process, each sprint tackling a facet of the bigger problem.

                    Since VTKO involves both Collaborati and Teamconnect CSM, my manager and I decided to take on one product in the design sprints; 
                    I focused on designing solutions for Collaborati, while my manager handled TeamConnect CSM. Communication and collaboration were crucial since we each worked on different products that are deeply intertwined with each other. 
                    Our goal was to develop a holistic solution. Some (not all) of the wireframes from each sprint are shared below.

                        Although the goal is to combine the TK and rate requests into one, there could be a scenario when the client adds new matter information in TeamConnect CSM and assigns timekeepers that are already approved to work on a different matter. There is another use case where the client may add a vendor that is already approved to the newly created matter, and the vendor gets notified and sends new TK’s to work on that new matter. I had to design workflows that cover both scenarios.

Most of the work done in this sprint was in TeamConnect CSM since the tolerance setting and validation would live there.

                    This is one of my favorite stages of the entire design process because it feels as if the solutions we produced get one step closer to becoming a reality.

                    Design sprint was a lot different than PI (program increment) sprint in that I had the creative freedom to come up with as many ideas as I could without a lot of restrictions. 
                    I also loved the amount of collaboration the team brought to this discovery work; we met frequently and bounced ideas back and forth with an open mind. 
                    Working hand-in-hand with another designer (my manager) provided a huge learning experience for me. She truly helped me expand my horizons and gain confidence in my design skills. 
                    Although the design sprint weeks were jam-packed with deliverables and meetings, those were also the <b>most exciting, inspiring, and productive</b> weeks. However, that doesn’t mean we haven’t had any setbacks. 
                </div>
                <div>
                    Initially, we had trouble getting feedback from customers. We would share our forward-thinking designs in the one-hour client working groups following each design sprint, but due to the amount of work we had to share, we would often run out of time for feedback. 
                    After two lackluster working groups, I made a suggion that we utilize the client working groups to do <b>user testing</b>. Rather than just going through our interactive prototypes and explaining our rationale, we would ask the participants to perform specific tasks using the prototypes. 
                    The groups were relatively small - consisted of 2-3 people - so this method was effective. It also sprouted engagement from everyone on the call, as well.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The other challenge we initially ran into was collaboration. This stemmed from my manager working remotely in Houston, TX, while everyone else on the team worked out of the Austin office. 
                    Communicating and brainstorming ideas together became difficult at times due to distance. Therefore, we used a tool called <a target='_blank' href='https://miro.com/'>Miro</a> to combat this. 
                    This platform allowed us to build user flows together and share comments in real-time. In addition to that, my manager drove to Austin for the last two design sprints and spent the first two days, so that we could brainstorm and do sketches together in-person.
