                    <p>
                        I’m Kailyn, a UX/UI designer based in Austin, TX.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began my design journey hand-lettering my favorite quotes and designing my high school’s yearbook for three years. I was one of the design editors in my yearbook class and fell in love with typography, colors, photography, and InDesign. Basically, I was a huge nerd. Not wanting to put design completely aside but still wanting to do something creative, I went to school for advertising and found myself spending more time making recommendations on the landing page user experience and optimization than creating media plans in Excel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I fell in love with UX because it is centered around the people.  Just like how a good-looking ad can’t be successful unless it is served to the right people in their “micro-moments”, a digital interface must understand the users’ needs and provide a seamless experience for them first and foremost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, I just want to design things for people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time, I can usually be found hiking/swimming with my dogs, taking photos of food and flowers, getting boba, watching YouTube tutorials, and listening to podcasts.  I’m inspired by people and their unique stories, as well as the diversity of nature.
                    </p>
