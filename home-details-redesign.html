                      At OJO, I worked on the consumer app, a conversational AI platform that empowers consumers to make better decisions in the home buying process. 
                      My responsibilities included redesigning the home listing page, as well as improving ways to get feedback signals from users. 
                      As the new enhancements or features rolled out, it was rewarding to see the consumer engagement rise and business metrics improve.

                The OJO home listing page is the most visited page in the app, as it houses a tremendous amount of content and functionality about both the home and its associated neighborhood.  It is also where OJO can learn a lot about the users' preferred style of home and enrich their recommendations going forward.

                  <div>
                    As additional features were added to the page over time, the efforts had become more "bolt-on" than thoughtful. Users had no clear way to schedule tours, and they had a difficult time finding the information they were looking for.

                    Keeping up-to-date on what the competitors are doing is part of a designer's job. The competitors I closely monitored included Redfin, Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, Open Listings and Localize.city. I mostly took notes on how they structured the page and prioritized the MLS data.

                OJO was in a unique position to be able to utilize all of the explicit and implicit signals from the users in providing better home insights and recommendations in a few months.

                  After three client working groups and countless internal discussions and brainstorming sessions, I created and delivered the <b>design specs in XD</b> to the dev team for implementation. 
                  The design specs included 8 final screens, 4 clickable prototypes, as well as all of the key UI elements that the developers must know to build the product. 
                  After the hand-off, I worked very closely with the developers to make sure all of the acceptance criteria had been met. 
                  Due to time constraints and limited resources, the final product did not end up looking exactly like my mockups. Balancing user needs with business requirements, I learned to negotiate and adjust expectations in order to make sure the end user goals were met.

                  This has to be one of my favorite projects I've worked on at Mitratech because of the amount of creative freedom I had, as well as the experience I gained. 
                  Because we built this product from scratch, we weren't bound by as many very specific boundaries as we would with legacy systems. 
                  I enjoyed working closely with the dev team during the implementation process; this team (we called ourselves the Titans) was extremely collaborative and open to ideas. 
                  Communicating information in every phase of the design process is the biggest lesson I learned from this project.
